# Golden Gecko Scripts

Here you will find a collection of scripts as and when I write them that help me with day to day activities on my Debian based home server.


Expect bugs, bad coding practices, etc. Edits/suggestions are welcomed however bare in mind that I'm not actively developing any of this as it stands.
